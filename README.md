# SimpleDatabase
Simple Database based on SQLite
-	Experimented with building a simple database by reading a tutorial on cloning SQLite using C
-	Replicated the system by taking user data from the frontend tokenizer, delivering an instruction to an SQL-based virtual machine, and then storing the data into the backend data structure to minimize the complexity.
